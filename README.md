# 🌐 Dashboard Application

Welcome to the repository of my Dashboard Application. This project is a command center I've developed for visualizing key data through an engaging and interactive UI. My aim was to create a tool that allows users to monitor and analyze various metrics like sales and email statistics effortlessly.

## 📜 Overview

Within this application, I've pieced together a series of data visualizations and utilities that offer a comprehensive view of business analytics. Designed with the user experience in mind, it features both light and dark modes to cater to individual preferences.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

The dashboard utilizes these technologies:

- **React.js**: A library for crafting dynamic, component-based UIs.
- **Material-UI**: A React UI framework offering ready-to-use components.
- **Nivo**: A library for creating rich, interactive data visualizations.
- **Formik**: A form creation and validation library.
- **Yup**: A schema builder for value parsing and validation, works well with Formik.
- **DataGrid**: A Material-UI component for displaying and manipulating data tables efficiently.
- **FullCalendar**: A comprehensive package for managing and interacting with events in a calendar.
